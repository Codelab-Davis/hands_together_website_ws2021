# CodeLab Hands Together Project


## Getting Started 

To run this project for the first time: 

1. In ./backend, add a file called .env. To get it's contents, check the pinned post in the Slack channel ;) 
2. In ./backend, run `npm i` in the console. 
3. In the root directory, run `npm i` in the console. 
4. To start your backend, in ./backend run `nodemon server` in the console. Your backend will now be located on a localhost, or a server hosted locally on your computer. By default, it will be `http://localhost:5000/`. 
5. To start your React app, in the root directory, run `npm start` in the console. Your backend will now be located on `http://localhost:3000/`.
